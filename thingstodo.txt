Key Take-aways:

We went through the project very carefully and found a lot of bugs. Mainly, the most crucial part is HTML semantic. You can validate the page at https://validator.w3.org/ and see the page is not valid. Other notes for each part of the project can be found below.

Based on all mentioned cons, the project's outcome doesn't meet STRV level of web performance.

Thumbs down	Assets, CSS quality, Functionality, HTML 5 tags, JS quality, Pixel Perfection, Project setup (packages, structure)
Two thumbs down	Environment setup (+ linting, minifying, deploying), HTML semantics/validation
Notes:

HTML semantics/validation	PROS: 1) claims NEW STRV, HANDMADE and STRV M6 done in simple divs (no heading) CONS: 1) no `alt` attribute on `img` tags 2) navigation should be done as unsorted list 3) how it works sections should be done as sorted list 4) duplicated content (titles) in header & footer (+ multiple h1 and h2) 5) messy headings sequence in Comments section 6) duplicated IDs selector 7) `script` between `body` and `html` 8) in comments section there should be an input for writing comment, no just a div 9) icons for social links at footer should be done as hyperlinks
Project setup (packages, structure)	PROS: 1) use of PUH for views CONS: 1) no automatization (grunt/gulp/webpack) 2) no packages management (npm/bower...) 3) SASS compilation is running outside of the project (probably - no setup in the project)
CSS quality	PROS: 1) use of SASS 2) multiple files NEUTRAL: 1) some formating of sass files would be appreciated - it is super hard to read such a messy files 2) no mobile first approach CONS: 1) no use of variables 2) using !important 3) hard-to-read naming conventions 4) no autoprefixer / vendor mixins 5) cross browser compatibility
Assets	PROS: 1) fonts via Google Fonts CONS: 1) size of images - it is unwanted to load images that have +2MB (covers) 2) icons should be done using svg (or iconfont) 3) background images in header and footer should be jpegs 4) no retina images (car, avatars)
HTML 5 tags	PROS: 1) use of `footer`, `nav` CONS: 1) no use of `header`, `section`, `article`
Functionality	PROS: 1) mobile navigation CONS: 1) anchors in navigation should scroll smoothly with animation 2) comments section (missing: validation of input, handle comments count, reply)
Pixel Perfection	CONS: 1) differences in sizes from provided designs (mobile & desktop) - paddings, button sizes, mobile menu etc. 2) no hover effects on navigation
JS quality	NEUTRAL: 1) Very basic use of jQuery
Environment setup (+ linting, minifying, deploying)	CONS: 1) No env setup 2) No minifying
